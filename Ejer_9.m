%exercise 8.9
%One of the programs in Section 8.2 shows that an amount of $1000 will double in eight
%years with an interest rate of 10%. Using the same interest rate, run the program with
%initial balances of $500, $2000, and $10,000 (say) to see how long they take to double.
%The results may surprise you.
